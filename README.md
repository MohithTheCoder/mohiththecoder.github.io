# About Me
## My Interests
I am interested in a lot of things like sports, video games, and reading.

I play multiple sports competitively, like Tennis and baseball, while playing football, soccer, basketball and more for fun. I am a Boston sports fan (Patriots, Celtics, Red Sox, Bruins) amd a Duke fan

Video Games I like to play include: Madden, Fifa, and Minecraft.

I like to read different books with my favorite genre being Sci-Fi. I am currently reading the Midnight Library, by Mattt Haig.

## Websites I Reccomend
- [Netflix] (https://www.netflix.com/) - I highly reccomend Netflix because it is a great why to pass time and you can explore your various interests further.
- [New York Times] (https://www.nytimes.com/) - I like the New York Times because there is different brain teasers on the website and games while also being able to learn a lot about what is going in the current world.
